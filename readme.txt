Provides a shortcode and a template tag to embed the latest video or current live stream of one or more YouTube channels.

== Description ==

The plugin provides a shortcode and a template tag to embed the latest video or current live stream of one or more YouTube channels.
It comes with an options page to let you set the default options for YouTube ID(s), width, height, autoplay and count of latest videos to embed. You can customize these parameters with the shortcode and template tag if needed.

This also works great with YouTube Live, by following this fallback progression.

1. If you're currently live, display the live video.
2. If you're not currently live, display the next upcoming live event.
3. If there is no upcoming live event, display the text from Settings > Ixiter Show Latest YT > Show message if not broadcasting.
4. If there is no "not broadcasting" message, show the most recent YouTube video(s) from your channel(s).

This plugin is now frequently maintained by [Daniel J. Lewis](http://danieljlewis.net) from [The Audacity to Podcast](http://TheAudacitytoPodcast.com/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the complete `ix-show-latest-yt` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. GoTo the plugins options page and setup your default settings
6. Done

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to have the last 3 or so videos showing? =

Yes. You can set a default option for "count of latest videos to embed" and use a parameter/attribute in Template tag and shortcode as well.

= Is it possible to set the video start playing automatically? =

Yes. You can set a default option for "autoplay" and use a parameter/attribute in Template tag and shortcode as well. If you set "count of latest videos" higher than 1, only the first video will autoplay. If you manually insert more than one video, for the love of all mankind, please don't make them all autoplay.

= Can I use more than one YouTube channel? =

Yes. You can specify a YouTube channel for each shortcode and template tag instance. But you can also combine multiple YouTube channels by typing them as a comma-separated list (for example, `moritzhangouttv,theaudacitytopodcast,oncepodcast`) in the default settings, or for each shortcode and template tag instance.

= Can the player automatically refresh between events? =

Live-refresh is something we're working on and is coming soon.

= Can this display videos from a playlist? =

Not yet.
